<b>ngc-learn</b> is a Python library for building, simulating, and analyzing arbitrary
predictive processing (or predictive coding) models based on the neural generative
coding (NGC) computational framework as well as other neurobiologically-motivated/grounded
systems. This toolkit is built on top of Tensorflow 2 and is distributed under the 3-Clause BSD license.

It is currently maintained by the
<a href="https://www.cs.rit.edu/~ago/nac_lab.html">Neural Adaptive Computing (NAC) laboratory</a>.

<!--The technical report going over the theoretical underpinnings of the
    NGC framework can be found here. TO BE RELEASED SOON. -->

## <b>Installation:</b>

<i>Setup:</i> Ensure that you have installed the following base dependencies in
your system. Note that this library was developed on Ubuntu 18.04 and tested on
Ubuntu(s) 16.04 and 18.04 (and should also work on Ubuntu 20.04).
ngc-learn requires:
1) Python (>=3.7)
2) Numpy (>=1.20.0)
3) Tensorflow 2.0.0, specifically, tensorflow-gpu>=2.0.0
4) scikit-learn (>=0.24.2) if using `ngclearn.density` (needed for the demo/tutorial
    files in `examples/`)
5) matplotlib (>=3.4.3) (for the demo/tutorial files in `examples/`)
6) networkx  (>=2.6.3) (currently optional but required if using `ngclearn.utils.experimental.viz_utils`)
7) pyviz (>=0.2.0) (currently optional but required if using `ngclearn.utils.experimental.viz_utils`)

(Which you can have setup/installed using [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/).)

Once you have ensured that the above dependencies have been installed, you can then
run the setup script at the top of the <code>ngclearn</code> directory
to have the <code>ngclearn</code> package install on your system using the
following bash command:
<pre>
$ python setup.py install
</pre>

If the installation was successful, you should see the following if you test
it against your Python interpreter, i.e., run the <code>$ python</code> command
and complete the following sequence of steps as depicted in the screenshot below:<br>
